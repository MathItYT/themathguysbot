# TheMathGuysBot ðŸ¤–
This is an AI-powered Discord bot designed to assist with math problems and provide explanations. It uses OpenAI models to generate rigorous solutions and explanations for various math problems, in addition to generating Manim animations to visualize and better understand the solutions. It also includes a LaTeX renderer for displaying math equations in a clear and professional manner, as Discord does not support LaTeX natively. Notice that this bot is only intended for The Math Guys Discord server and is not intended for public use. So, if you need a similar bot for your own server, you can fork this repository and deploy it on your own platform.
